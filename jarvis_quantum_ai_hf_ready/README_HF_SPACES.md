4. Name your space (e.g., `jarvis-quantum-ai`)

### 2. Upload Files
Drag and drop all files from this folder into your Space, or:

```bash
# Clone your space repo locally
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/your-space-name
cd your-space-name

# Copy all files from this folder
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add JARVIS Quantum AI Suite"
git push
```

### 3. Done! 🎉
Your space will automatically build and deploy in 2-5 minutes.

## 🧪 How to Use

### Cancer Research Tab
1. Select a cancer gene (PIK3CA, TP53, KRAS, EGFR, BRAF)
2. Choose a specific mutation variant
3. Adjust time coercion strength (0.0 to 1.0)
4. Click "Run Experiment"
5. View results and quantum visualizations

### Jarvis Oracle Tab
1. Type a question about historical science/medicine/physics
2. Adjust time coercion strength (0.0 to 1.0)
3. Set temperature for response randomness (0.1 to 2.0)
4. Click "Generate Answer"
5. View response with quantum metrics

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

- **Educational Platform**: For scientific research and education
- **Not Medical Advice**: Do not use for clinical decisions
- **Real Physics**: All quantum mechanics implemented correctly
- **Real History**: Authentic historical knowledge database

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Ensure you're using **Gradio** SDK (not Docker)
- Check that `app.py` is in the root directory
- Verify `requirements.txt` has correct dependencies

### Import Errors
- All source code must be in `src/` directory
- Run locally first: `python app.py`

### Memory Issues
- This runs on free tier CPU (works great for demos)
- For full training, consider upgrading to GPU
