# Changelog

## v0.6.0
- Introduced synthetic medicinal discovery workflows with adapter logging and ethics guidance.
- Added 3D computing map visualiser capable of exporting headless artefacts.
- Added Schwarzschild geodesic and lensing simulators with CLI entry points.
- Extended π-phase experiments with coupling, drift, noise, and entropy controls.
- Integrated telemetry CSV logging for all experiments.
- Documented replayable experiment outcomes in `docs/experiment_results.md` with direct artifact references.

## v0.7.0
- Added entropy-collapse scans and CLI support for analysing discrete decoherence steps in the π-phase suite.
- Extended the atom module with a 2D molecule-style transition that couples phase entropy into interference fringe formation.
- Linked medicinal docking scores to π-phase entropy weights for hybrid physics-chemistry scoring.
- Introduced lens/atom equivalence reporting that correlates micro-scale Schwarzschild renders with atom densities and emits PNG artefacts.
- Updated the 3D computing map loader to accept saved JSON densities and added a `master_discovery.py` orchestrator for demo bundles.
