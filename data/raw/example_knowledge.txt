JARVIS-2v is a modular edge AI system with adapter-based intelligence.

The core intelligence of JARVIS-2v resides in three primary systems:
1. AdapterEngine - Modular AI adapters with graph relationships
2. Y/Z/X bit routing - 16-bit Y (task/domain), 8-bit Z (difficulty), 8-bit X (experimental)
3. Memory system - Persistent facts, topics, and conversation history

Adapters are non-destructive learning units that never overwrite existing knowledge.

The synthetic quantum engine generates experimental artifacts that link to adapters.

The base GGUF model serves only as a language decoder, not the intelligence itself.

Training in JARVIS-2v means creating new adapters, not fine-tuning the base model.

All adapter creation is incremental and preserves the existing knowledge graph.

Y-bits encode task domains: programming (bit 0), mathematics (bit 1), quantum (bit 2), explanation (bit 3).

Z-bits encode difficulty and precision levels for task routing.

X-bits are experimental toggles for features like quantum simulation or recall-only modes.

The adapter graph uses NetworkX to track relationships between adapters.

Each adapter has metadata including task tags, parameters, rules, prompts, and success metrics.

Adapters can have parent-child relationships to form knowledge hierarchies.

Quantum artifacts are linked to adapters to provide experimental context.

JARVIS-2v supports edge deployment on devices like Jetson Orin NX.

The system uses GGUF format models for efficient inference on CPU and GPU.

Memory persistence allows JARVIS-2v to remember conversations and facts across sessions.

Web search integration provides real-time information retrieval via DuckDuckGo.

The UI shows adapter statistics, memory browser, and quantum lab experiments.
