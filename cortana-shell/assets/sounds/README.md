# Sound Effects

Place Cortana sound effects here (optional).

Suggested files:

- `wake.mp3` – Sound when wake word is detected
- `listening.mp3` – Sound when starting to listen
- `response.mp3` – Sound when response is ready
- `error.mp3` – Sound for errors

These can be triggered in the UI or voice manager for enhanced feedback.
