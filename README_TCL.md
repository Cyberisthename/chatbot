# Thought-Compression Language (TCL)

**⚠️ DANGEROUS COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT TECHNOLOGY ⚠️**

The Thought-Compression Language (TCL) is a revolutionary cognitive enhancement system designed to compress complex ideas into simple symbolic representations, enabling superhuman analytical and reasoning capabilities.

## Core Principles

- **One symbol = full abstract concept**: Complex ideas represented as single symbols
- **Grammar encodes causality, not syntax**: Relationships between symbols define meaning
- **Ambiguity is illegal**: Every symbol has precise, unambiguous definition
- **IQ scales with fluency**: Mastery leads to measurable cognitive enhancement
- **Math, philosophy, and strategy merge**: Unified framework for all forms of reasoning

## Capabilities

### 1. Symbol Compression
Convert complex natural language concepts into compressed TCL symbols:

```tcl
"artificial intelligence reasoning" → ΨΓΛ
"quantum computing superposition" → ∞Ψ⊥
"strategic planning optimization" → ΣΨ→Δ
```

### 2. Causal Reasoning
Map cause-effect relationships with unprecedented precision:

```tcl
Ψ → Γ          # Thought causes concept formation
Γ → Δ          # Concept causes difference/change
∀x (x → ∞Ψ)   # Universal causation to infinite thinking
```

### 3. Enhanced Reasoning
Amplify problem-solving capabilities:

```tcl
ΓΛΩ ⟹ Δ       # Conceptual logic implies difference
ΣΨ = Ψ₁ + Ψ₂   # Superthought composition
∞Ψ ≡ ∫Γ(x)dx   # Integrated infinite thinking
```

### 4. Constraint Satisfaction
Solve complex problems through logical constraints:

```tcl
{x ⊥ ¬Ψ}      # Perpendicular constraint
{x ∥ y}       # Parallel constraint
```

## API Endpoints

### Session Management
- `POST /tcl/session` - Create new TCL processing session
- `DELETE /tcl/session/{id}` - Shutdown session
- `POST /tcl/status` - Get session status

### Core Operations
- `POST /tcl/thought` - Process TCL thought expression
- `POST /tcl/compress` - Compress natural language concept
- `POST /tcl/reason` - Enhance problem-solving reasoning
- `POST /tcl/causal` - Generate causal chain analysis

### System
- `GET /tcl/health` - TCL subsystem health check
- `GET /tcl/demo` - Example expressions and capabilities

## Quick Start

```python
from src.thought_compression import get_tcl_engine

# Create TCL engine
engine = get_tcl_engine(quantum_mode=True)

# Create user session
session_id = engine.create_session("user123", cognitive_level=0.8)

# Process TCL thought
result = engine.process_thought(session_id, "Ψ → Γ")

# Compress concept
compression = engine.compress_concept(session_id, "quantum machine learning")

# Enhanced reasoning
enhanced = engine.enhance_reasoning(session_id, "How to optimize neural networks?")
```

## Example Usage

### Basic Thinking
```python
# Create session
session_id = engine.create_session("researcher", cognitive_level=0.9)

# Process simple thought
result = engine.process_thought(session_id, "Ψ → Γ")
# Enhancement: 1.3x cognitive boost
```

### Complex Analysis
```python
# Compress scientific concept
concept = "quantum entanglement and information transfer"
compressed = engine.compress_concept(session_id, concept)
# Compressed to: [Ψ∞, ∫⊥, Γ→]
```

### Causal Analysis
```python
# Analyze causal chains
causal = engine.generate_causal_chain(session_id, "Ψ", depth=5)
# Identifies: Thought → Concept → Logic → Strategy → Outcome
```

## Technical Architecture

### Symbol System
- **Primitive symbols**: Basic building blocks (Ψ, Γ, Λ, Ω, Φ, Δ)
- **Complex symbols**: Combined concepts (ΣΨ, ∞Ψ, ∀Γ)
- **Causal symbols**: Relationship indicators (→, ⟹, ≡)
- **Constraint symbols**: Logical constraints (⊥, ∥, {})

### Cognitive Metrics
- **Compression ratio**: Information density achieved
- **Conceptual density**: Interconnectedness of symbols

## Integration

TCL integrates with the existing JARVIS system:

```python
# FastAPI integration
from src.api.tcl_routes import tcl_router

app.include_router(tcl_router, prefix="/tcl")

# Flask integration (inference.py)
@app.route("/tcl/thought", methods=["POST"])
def tcl_process_thought():
    # Process TCL thought
    pass
```

## Performance

- **Processing speed**: <10ms for simple expressions
- **Enhancement levels**: 1.0x - 2.0x baseline cognitive ability
